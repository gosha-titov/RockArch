// Implementation notes
// ====================
//
// Embedded child modules are already built, loaded and automatically started/stoped.
// That is, there's no need to call the `invokeChildModule(byName:animation:)` method.

/// A router that is responsible for the hierarchy of modules: showing and hiding child modules, completing the module.
///
/// The `RARouter` class defines the shared behavior thatâ€™s common to all routers.
/// You almost always subclass the `RARouter` but you make minor changes,
/// since each router has already defined all transitions between modules.
///
/// The router has a lifecycle consisting of the `setup()` and `clean()` methods,
/// which are called when the module is attached to or detached from the module tree.
/// You can override these to perform additional initialization on your properties and, accordingly, to clean them.
///
/// If the module has embedded children, you can access them by using the `embeddedViewControllers` property and
/// by redefining the `loadEmbeddedViewControllers()` method to make sure they really exist.
/// It's used if you want to custom display these child controllers.
///
/// - Note: Each component can log messages by calling the `log(_:category:level:)` method.
/// These messages are handled by the current black box with its loggers.
